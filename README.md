## How to install

Simply [download the VSIX file](https://rawgit.com/leboeuf/snake-extension/master/SnakeExtension.vsix) and double-click it to add the extension to Visual Studio.

## How to run

The Snake tool window will automatically be shown and focussed when a build is started, and closed when the build is completed or cancelled.

You can also open it manually by going to **View > Other windows > Snake**.

## How to play

Use the arrow keys or the **WASD keys** to change direction.

If you decide to dock the tool window, the arrow keys might not behave correctly. This is caused by the way Visual Studio handles the arrow keys to navigate between UI elements in the IDE. Use the WASD keys instead.
